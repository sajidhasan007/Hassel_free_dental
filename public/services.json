        "description": "If you have one or more missing teeth, your dental professional may recommend that you get artificial replacements. There are removable options like dentures that you can take out and clean, but those can slide around, shift, or fall out â€“ which understandably won't fly for many people. And that's why there are crowns affixed to dental implants and bridges which function more like your actual teeth. But between crown implants and bridges, which option is the best choice for you? We'll break down the similarities, differences, advantages, and disadvantages between these two fixed artificial tooth options so that even if you have a fake tooth or two, you'll have a smile that's as real as can be."

You may experience some pain and discomfort for up to 48 hours after having root planing."
