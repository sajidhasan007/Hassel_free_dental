                <h2>What is Isolight?</h2>
                <p>Isolight is an advanced system that relaxes the jaw, prevents muscle and joint fatigue, prevents gagging and water accumulation in the throat. It works to remove water from your mouth, while simultaneously providing light for your dentist to see their work. By having the light source on the Isolight tool, you don’t have to deal with a bright light in your eyes during your visit.</p>
